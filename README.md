Problems:
Our metric extraction algorithm includes .java files outside of the "src" folder. This means there are 2 entries in the extracted .xlsx file that do not exist in the provided Code_Smells.xlsx file when analysing the jasml project.
The evaluated code smells aren't separated from the regular metrics in the UI. They are instead shown in the same table, using the structure found in the generated .xlsx file
In trello, when using the Plus! plugin, we often add issues with desynced spend/estimates, where the values shown were significantly different between users. This lead to a very large spike, as each of us kept readjusting the numbers because what they saw was wrong.
